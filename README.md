- Fade in/out each LED Individually.
- Fade in/out all LEDs at once .
- Randomly turn on/off LED .
- Randomly turn on/off group of LEDs .

**Notes**

- This project has been written for Arduino-UNO r3 so you may need to change PWM pins number in order to get that program work on other Arduino boards .
- You can apply those effects to 6 LEDs (each connected to PWM pin) 
- You can apply them to 6 different LEDs series (each series connected to PWM pin , the LEDs in that series all will be lit at once ) 

**Bugs**
Report if you found any .
	
**Targets are planned for next releases**

- Change current effect using push-button .
- Choose effects from PC .
